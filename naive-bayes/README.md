# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a classifier that uses the Bayes Theorem to predict the likelihood of a feature set being in a particular class. The probability that a feature set belongs to a class is computed for each class in the data set and the class with the highest probability is returned as the class of the feature set.

# Implementation
This implementation is pretty tightly coupled with the data set in use, although a little tweaking can make it usable with any data set.
